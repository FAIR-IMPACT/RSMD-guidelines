# Research Software MetaData (RSMD) Guidelines

Welcome to the RSMD-guidelines repository!

### Overview
RSMD is a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at enhancing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research software artifacts within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). Developed as part of the FAIR-IMPACT project, RSMD represents the inaugural proposal of standardized metadata standards for research software.

### Features
- **Standardized Metadata:** RSMD offers flexible and adaptable recommendations for collecting and curating metadata attributes essential for research software, ensuring alignment with FAIR principles.
- **Community Engagement:** RSMD encourages collaboration and feedback from researchers, developers, and stakeholders to refine and evolve the guidelines over time, promoting widespread adoption and adherence.
- **Integration with EOSC:** RSMD aims to integrate seamlessly with existing Open Science environments and services established within the EOSC, enhancing the discoverability and usability of research software artifacts.

### Getting Started
#### Using the RSMD guidelines in in your software
To start using RSMD in your research projects, simply:
1. Review the [RSMD Guidelines](https://fair-impact.github.io/RSMD-guidelines/) to understand the recommended metadata attributes and best practices.
2. Checkout the [RSMD checklist](https://fair-impact.github.io/RSMD-guidelines/8.rsmd_checklist/).
3. Incorporate relevant metadata fields into your software documentation and repository workflows.

#### Implementing the guidelines in your institution
To implement the RSMD in a research institution:
1. Fork this repository with new name, such as `RSMD-guidelines@YYY`
   - for example at INRIA, use `RSMD-guidelines@INRIA`
2. Add instructions on how the recommendations is interpreted in th institution
   - for example at INRIA, RSMD 2.1 will contain instructions on depositing in [HAL](https://hal.science/)

3. Add in the Citation section credit to the individuals in your institution contributing to the effort.

#### Implementing the guidelines in your infrastructure
The implementation pathway of the RSMD guidelines in a research infrastructure is yet to be defined.
