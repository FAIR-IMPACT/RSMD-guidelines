# Research Software MetaData (RSMD) Gudelines

Welcome to the RSMD-guidelines repository!

### Overview:
RSMD is a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at enhancing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research software artifacts within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). Developed as part of the FAIR-IMPACT project, RSMD represents the inaugural proposal of standardized metadata standards for research software.

### Features:
- **Standardized Metadata:** RSMD offers flexible and adaptable recommendations for collecting and curating metadata attributes essential for research software, ensuring alignment with FAIR principles.
- **Community Engagement:** RSMD encourages collaboration and feedback from researchers, developers, and stakeholders to refine and evolve the guidelines over time, promoting widespread adoption and adherence.
- **Integration with EOSC:** RSMD aims to integrate seamlessly with existing Open Science environments and services established within the EOSC, enhancing the discoverability and usability of research software artifacts.

### Getting Started:
To start using RSMD in your research projects, simply:
1. Review the RSMD Guidelines document to understand the recommended metadata attributes and best practices.
2. Checkout the RSMD checklist
3. Incorporate relevant metadata fields into your software documentation and repository workflows.
4. Engage with the RSMD community to provide feedback, contribute improvements, and share experiences.
