# Accessibility and preservation 

## Objective
To ensure accessibility and preservation, researchers and software engineers are strongly recommended to follow the archival and sharing recommendations below.

## Recommendations
### RSMD-2.1
**Essential ☆☆☆**

Archive the source code repository in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">universal source code archive</span>, [Software Heritage](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/), using the [save code now,](save.softwareheritage.org) to ensure long-term access to the full development history. 

* This method can be used for software at any level of maturity when software is publicly available. 

### RSMD-2.2
**Essential ☆☆☆**

Archive software source code in a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">scholarly repository</span> (e.g [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [HAL](https://hal.science/)) to ensure that software can be found and accessed in a _scholarly context_. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note</span>: Proprietary software can be deposited in an institutional repository.

* This method should be used when a software object is ready to be reported and shared. Some repositories offer the possibility to create a software record with the archived copy in RSMD-2.1 (e.g [HAL](https://www.softwareheritage.org/2023/04/04/swhid-deposit-hal/))



### RSMD-2.3
**Important ☆☆**

Register software projects in a disciplinary or community registry (e.g [ascl.net](https://ascl.net/), [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/), [swMath](https://zbmath.org/software/), [RRID portal](https://scicrunch.org/resources/about/resource), [RSD](https://research-software-directory.org/),  [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)) to ensure that software can be found and accessed. 

To answer this recommendation, semi-automatic tools should be provided by infrastructures to reduce duplication of effort done by researchers or software creators.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note:</span> Proprietary software can be registered in an institutional catalog (e.g the INRIA BIL).
