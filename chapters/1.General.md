# General Metadata Recommendations

## Objective
To ensure the collection, curation, and maintenance of research software metadata, the following general recommendations are suggested for end users, including researchers, software engineers, curators, and institution staff.

## Recommendations
### RSMD-1.1
**Essential ☆☆☆**

Provide embedded information about software in the code itself as a metadata file (intrinsic metadata) to ensure it is kept and maintained alongside the software. Can be applied to open and proprietary software.


### RSMD-1.2
**Essential ☆☆☆**

Issue a metadata record (extrinsic metadata) about the source code in a publicly available infrastructure to benefit from the infrastructure metadata service (such as citation exports and search functionalities):
* scholarly repository (e.g HAL, Zenodo, etc.)
* publisher (e.g IPOL, eLife, [Dagstuhl](https://www.dagstuhl.de/), etc.)
* registry/ aggregator (e.g ASCL, swMath, WikiData, DataCite, bio.tools, etc.)
* directory (e.g [eScience RSD](https://research.software), [Helmholtz RSD](https://helmholtz.software), etc.)


### RSMD-1.3
**Important ☆☆**

Use a version control system to track changes in the source code development and facilitate archival.  If an online platform is used, capture the URL in a **CodeRepository** property.

### RSMD-1.4
**Useful ☆**

Follow community standards when developing software: An example can be language-specific standards and best practices (e.g. DESCRIPTION file in R, see also https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/08-making-packages-R.html).

### RSMD-1.5
**Useful ☆**

Keep the machine readable intrinsic metadata information in a single source file, and automatically generate other file formats, to avoid misalignment and duplication (e.g. generate citation.cff from codemeta.json) wherever possible.
