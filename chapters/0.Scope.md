# Scope

The RSMD guidelines provide a standardized community based requirements and recommendations to end users in the following areas:
- General metadata requirements
- Accessibility and preservation (A = Archive)
- Reference and identification (R = Reference)
- Description and classification (D =  Describe)
- Credit and attribution (C = Cite)
- Reuse, licensing and legal aspects
- Re-executability: dependencies and execution environment

While the guidelines cover a broad range of aspects, they primarily focus on metadata collection, management, and curation, and do not address software engineering practices such as software quality, testing, performance optimization, or collaboration.

## Out of scope

The following elements are considered out of scope for this document:
1. Skills: While important, the discussion of end-users skills and training falls beyond the scope of this document.
2. Homogeneity between disciplines and user profiles: Addressing the heterogeneity of disciplines and user profiles is beyond the scope of this document.
3. Documentation: Although essential for comprehensive software, the specific guidance and best practices on documenting code fall outside the perimeter of this document.

## The recommendations 
The RSMD guidelines are organized into seven distinct aspects, each with a clear high-level objective and a set of actionable and detailed recommendations. Each recommendation is uniquely identified using the semantic identifier `RSMD-X.Y`, where X represents the aspect number and Y represents the recommendation number. Priorities are assigned to each recommendation, categorized into three levels: essential (highest priority), important, and useful (lowest priority). This prioritization helps to emphasize the critical recommendations and ensure that the guidelines address key areas effectively.
