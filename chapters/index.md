# The Research Software MetaData Guidelines for End-Users
Welcome to the RSMD-guidelines page.

## Overview
The Research Software MetaData (RSMD) guidelines is a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at enhancing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research software artifacts within the [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/) and beyond. Developed as part of the [FAIR-IMPACT project](https://fair-impact.eu/), the RSMD v1.0 represents the inaugural proposal of standardized metadata standards for research software.

## Getting Started
To start using RSMD in your research projects:

1. Review the RSMD Guidelines document to understand the recommended metadata attributes and best practices.
2. Checkout the RSMD checklist
3. Incorporate relevant metadata fields into your software documentation and repository workflows.
4. Engage with the RSMD community to provide feedback, contribute improvements, and share experiences.
