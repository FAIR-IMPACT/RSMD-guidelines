# RSMD checklist 

The Research Software MetaData (RSMD) guidelines are a cross-disciplinary community driven effort to provide standardized and actionable guidance for the metadata collection and curation of research software.
To assist software creators in self-archiving and self-metadata curation, FAIR-IMPACT has created the RSMD checklist as a self contained questionnaire. The RSMD checklist which is addressing all the RSMD guidelines recommendations as a set of questions that can be used by the software creator or the software curator. By using the checklist, software creators can ensure that their software has the necessary metadata to be accessible, discoverable and reusable.
