# RSMD checklist 

## Introduction 

The Research Software MetaData (RSMD) guidelines are a cross-disciplinary community driven effort to provide standardized and actionable guidance for the metadata collection and curation of research software.

To assist **software creators** in self-archiving and self-metadata curation, FAIR-IMPACT has created the RSMD checklist as a self contained questionnaire. The RSMD checklist which is addressing all the RSMD guidelines recommendations as a set of questions that can be used by the software creator or the software curator. By using the checklist, software creators can ensure that their software has the necessary metadata to be accessible, discoverable and reusable.


### General Metadata Requirements

-   [ ] Does the software have metadata that is embedded in the source code (intrinsic metadata)? (RSMD-1.1)
-   [ ] Does the software project have a metadata record (extrinsic metadata) which is publicly available on an online scholarly platform? (RSMD-1.2)
    *   [ ]  Is the metadata record licensed as CC0?
-   [ ] Is the software also available in a version control system (VCS)? (RSMD-1.3)
    * [ ] if it is available online, is the url available in a code repository property in the intrinsic or/and extrinsic metadata?
-   [ ] Does the software follow language specific community standards? (RSMD-1.4)
-   [ ] Is the machine readable metadata information in a single file? (RSMD-1.5)



### Accessibility and preservation 

-   [ ] Is the software record or/and are the software artifacts accessible and preserved?
    *   [ ]  Is the software source code preserved in the SWH universal source code archive, [Software Heritage](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/)? (RSMD-2.1)
    *   [ ] Is the software archived in a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">scholarly repository</span> (e.g [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [HAL](https://hal.science/))? (RSMD-2.2)
    *   [ ] Can it be accessed and downloaded?  
-   [ ] Is the software registered in a disciplinary or community registry (e.g [ascl.net](https://ascl.net/), [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/), [swMath](https://zbmath.org/software/), [RRID portal](https://scicrunch.org/resources/about/resource), [RSD](https://research-software-directory.org/),  [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), [DataCite](https://datacite.org/))
    *   [ ] Can it be found in a search engine?
